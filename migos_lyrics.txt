The lyrics describe drug dealing whilst drawing several similarities with the popular Netflix original series of the same name, Narcos, which is centered around Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.Whilst the Migos' make multiple references to Latin countries, the official sample is taken from “Espoir” by Les Difficiles de Pétion-Ville, a song from Haïti.Yes.

In the Pharrell-produced song, Migos drop fast food references and flaunt their success.This marks the first time in a long time that the trio strayed away from their signature Atlanta trap sound and rap over a poppier beat.According to Quavo, they ran into Pharrell in Los Angeles when the N.E.R.D frontman stepped into one of their studio sessions with a “pack” of beats from 2008 earmarked for the Atlanta trio:We was in the studio in L.A. and he was in the next room. We had been running into each other, we’ve been cool, but he was over there working and he just stepped in because we just walk in everybody’s sessions and it’s love, and go to work. And Pharrell had, like, three or four beats, but the pack was from 2008, like, the old hard drive. He had the old pack. He said he was waiting on this moment. The genie way.The beat was originally intended for an unreleased T.I. song. Twitter user Erik Anderson pinpointed the track as “Trap Nigga Hustle,” which was recorded two years prior to the Atlanta rapper’s 2014 album Paperwork. T.I. mentioned it during an interview with DJ Whoo Kid and previewed the instrumental in a Vevo segment about his car collection:Though the sample is not directly credited, “Stir Fry” draws inspiration from The Mohawks‘ “The Champ". It’s been sampled in other hip-hop songs by artists like Ice Cube, Big Daddy Kane, and even Frank Ocean.Speaking to Ebro on Beats 1, Quavo stated the following:We had been running into each other, we’ve been cool, but he was over there working and he just stepped in because we just walk in everybody’s sessions and it’s love, and go to work. And he had, like, three or four beats, but the pack was from 2008, like, the old hard drive. He had the old pack. He said he was waiting on this moment. The genie way.Yes! “Stir Fry” was prominently featured in an ad for the iPhone X’s animoji feature – an iMessage widget that shows a 3D emoji mimicking your facial expressions while it “speaks” your pre-recorded audio message. The ad, which features a rapping dog, fox, and pile of poop, shows the animojis covering parts of Quavo’s and Takeoff’s verses, as well as the hook. The ad, which was used extensively on social media, has proven to be extremely popular with over two million views on YouTube.On July 19, 2018, “Stir Fry” officially went RIAA Double Platinum, being certified for 2,000,000 unit sales.“Stir Fry” peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at #3 on Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs charts.[Intro: Takeoff]

Even some of the lines of the song are the same. The hook in the song of Gucci Mane’s song goes:Please let me floss my jewellery, so much ice make your eye sight blurry
Jewellery, have on too much jewellery, never too much, never too much
So much jewellery, this ain’t even half my jewelleryIn “Too Much Jewelry” Quavo and Takeoff talk about their passion for diamonds, chains and all kind of jewelry. They can never stop buying more, they have more than anyone can imagine, and they are jewelry addicts.Although Offset doesn’t appear in the track, the two other Migos tell us how they set trends and awake others envy.[Intro: Takeoff]

Whether it be posting up smoking a fat blunt, or pulling up at an event suited up looking fresh just like they did at the 2017 Met Gala (see photo below), they are always doing it together, repping Migos as a team.  Their support for one another was clear during a 2017 BET awards interview with Complex News when Joe Budden abruptly left up while DJ Akademiks was interviewing Takeoff.  On their track “Ice Tray” they target Budden specifically saying:If a nigga hatin', call him Joe Budden (pussy)Proving that a slight against one of them is a slight against all of them.[Chorus: Travis Scott & Ty Dolla $ign]

Free all my nigga locked up in the cell, no cellular
I'm special, but first I was regular
Fuck the feds and free my niggas that’s federal
Couple scammers and some decimals
I'ma feed 'em to the animals
I let 'em play in the back with them lions
'Til he run out of the stamina
I told him "he stealing" he told me I'm lying
I told him I got him on camera
Act like I wanna make music with ya
Just to hit you and your manager

[Outro: Quavo]
Fuck it, crown the kings
Crown the kings
Fuck it, crown the kingsOn “Crown the Kings” Migos are saying that they deserve to be crowned as kings. They boast about being at the top. Only a few can leave this dream and they are part of this minority that is surrounded by expensive cars, jewelry, girls and celebrations.The song samples Bob Marley’s “Get Up Stand Up”.The lines heard are “get up” and “stand up for your rights” from Bob Marley & the Wailers' 1973 song “Get Up, Stand Up”, a song that protested the government’s lack of attention towards the poverty and inequality in countries such as Haiti and Jamaica.Although it sounds similar, the song does not sample “Power”.It actually samples a classic Bob Marley song called “Get Up, Stand Up”.[Intro]

Don't you come around that nawf 'cause it ain't safe, boy
Got my niggas from the nawf, but you don't play, boyThis R&B/ Jazz vibe that “Made Men” is built around is complemented by the smooth and deep voice of Takeoff. “Made Men” details the transition of worth they experienced and the how their lavish lifestyle was made for them.Further, going along with the mafia theme, in the American Mafia, a made man is a fully initiated member of the Mafia. To become “made”, an associate first has to be sponsored by another made man. An inductee will be required to take the oath of Omertà, the mafia code of silence. The Migos have had numerous chart-toppers, proving themselves in the industry.[Sample]

In the chorus, Quavo interpolates lyrics from late Atlanta legend Shawty Lo’s verse on “I’m Da Man” by D4L.Ke-mo sah-bee or kemosabe is a trusty scout or faithful friend. It was popularized by the TV series Lone RangerDue to Migos wearing all fur in the snowy environment, the aesthetic is comparable to The Revenant.[Intro: Takeoff]

It’s the first top 40 placement for both Lil Uzi & Migos.This is the first song Migos and Lil Uzi Vert collaborated on, however, Offset was featured on Lil Uzi Vert’s “Of Course We Ghetto Flowers”.Check this article for the history in particular behind the song and the word.Do it look like I’m left off Bad and Boujee?
“Bad and Boujee” was ranked #24 on Complex “50 Best Songs of 2016” list:The track is lurching and confident, the kind of song that’s sure of its own appeal but knows not to step outside of the pocket. It seems like an unlikely hit, but try listening just once.I had jumped on it in LA. I recorded that record in LA. Offset had already made the record.
– Quavo, The Bill Simmons Podcast, Oct. 23, 2018 (68:45)It was Takeoff’s choice to be “left off” and to give his verse to Lil Uzi Vert. All these people thinking that he is left behind should know that he is their backbone and it’s his choice to appear on less features and less on social medias.Rubi Rose, Clarke Lauren and Vivian KyongThere is this Genius page for the Turkish translations, as also the Polish one.[Intro: Quavo]

He has appeared before on tracks such as 2016’s “Now” and 2013’s “Dennis Rodman.” Additionally, Migos are thought to have inspired Gucci’s latest album title, Drop Top Wop.Gucci and the Migos have made countless collaborations and have even released an album together named “Green Album”.[Intro: Takeoff]

Can't compare to this, I'm takin' all the risks
Know how to solve a problem, know how to sell a brick
You might be poppin' them bottles, I'm poppin' them bottles and models
You might be ridin' American, my whips is foreign, the throttles
You tryna go big on big? stop it
I put a big... hole... in your pocket
They say they ridin' around the city broke
That's 'cause they tryna keep up with the 'cho (Keep up!)
Eyes closed, whippin' it blindfold
She get on that pole, get bi-polar
Six cell phones and I ain't social
Still goin' big, cup like Magnolia

[Chorus: Takeoff]
If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
If I got the Draco and you got the Sig
How you gon' big on big?
If I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid
How you gon' big on big?
If I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten
How you gon' big on big?
If your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten
How you gon' big on big?
You drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz
How you gon' big on big?
What you talkin' about? We done been did
How you gon' big on big?

[Verse 3: Offset]
How you gon'... flex on the squad?
When you know... the bag is large?
Where were you... when times was hard?
It's pitiful, how you gon' big when we extra large?
Four car garage... two bad broads
I don't flex or floss... I'm a rockstar
With no guitar, Lambo avatar (Lambo)
Sippin' on some tar (Act) I'm livin' above the bar
Wrist on froze, wrist on froze (Ice)
Your lil' hoe... been my hoe (Smash smash)
Green Lambo... Piccolo (Skrr skrr)
Diamonds drippin' on me, Nickelodeon (Splash)
You goin' too big, you talkin' 'bout money, you bother me
(You makin' me sick)
I own all of my cars, jewelry, and I got property
(I got some property)
Building these houses in places, I'm playing Monopoly
Please do not talk to me
You don't do nothin', you obsolete

[Chorus: Takeoff]
If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?

Their success is reaching new heights with songs like “Bad and Boujee” and previously released work, going from “big” to “bigger.” Migos is asking other rappers in the scene how they are planning to achieve the same success as they did.[Intro: Quavo]

Hold on (Woo, woo, woo, price, yeah!)Released on January 20th, 2017, “What the Price” is the fourth single off of Migos‘ highly anticipated sophomore album, Culture.Borrowing from their history of dealing drugs, Migos discuss the fluctuation of drug prices and their spending habits.Although “What the Price” has not received the wild success of “Bad and Boujee” and “T-Shirt”, the single  is a very worthy trap anthem, drawing off samples from Lil Bibby’s “Steph”, and Swipey’s  “Intro”.It’s a blend of both. The song discusses selling drugs, and the hook is obviously discussing drug trade on a cursory level. However, Takeoff’s first verse is about bypassing the paths that society gives us.It offers a very Frost-ian perspective on life without being an overtly conscious hip-hop song.[Intro: Offset]

If they got a problem, my niggas gon' straighten it
Niggas debatin', they hatin', they plottin', they waitin'
They want my ice, tell 'em come take it
Have people tell me that I couldn't make it

My momma told me I gotta stay humble
But don't be too ready, you gotta have patience

I wanna say, you always going out your way
Cancel all your plans, you will understand
You probably got your hands full, whatever goal you pursue
All this pain, we can live through it, it's called success

[Chorus: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I won't ask the bitch unless she goin' to get it
It might take a minute, but she'll be sure to get it
Just to pass the test, I won’t act the best
I got Actavis, there's nothing I can't ask the bitch, no
Not one missed call, no missed calls, hell nah, nah
She got a man, can't get involved, no, nah, nah
She still going all ways every time I call
We gonna ball today, ayy, we gonna ball tomorrow
I put this weight on like I put a cape on
Now that this fame came, I can see the hate on you
Mama told me stay strong, grandma told me stay on
Now she looking down, throwin' blessings

[Chorus: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Go out your way and come out
Go out your way to mom's house
Go out your way, so out your way
You going out your way to come back around
You go out your way, you keep cool
You go out your way, you break rules
Go out your way, so out your way
You're going out your way, you can't lose
Vacay trips to Cancun, spaceships, trips to the moon
Never likes to tell the truth
Head full of hair, but the cat well groomed
Plan a trip to Peru (Plan it), charter jet, me and you
You going out your way, way out your way
So I had to do this for you
Jackpot, hit the right spot, so she had to get a tattoo
It's some dirt and hurt, but ain't perfect
And she gone always, come through
Hold me down, either good or bad
Never switch or act brand new
Go out your way and wasn't told to
So I made this song just for you

[Chorus: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Offset]
I put my heart and my soul in it
Get to the money, then double it
All of these bitches, they loving me
But you had my back from the other beef (Yeah)
She bending over, back for me
Made a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me
It was so many people that doubted me
Shit talk, shit talk, bullets start to let off
Jack Frost, Jack Frost, wrist cost a whole house
Blast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off
We don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all
I been fucking on the gnats, nigga, all day
Ride through the city, yeah, the ball way
We was trappin', cappin' all through the hallway
Everybody said that we would fall away
Nobody thought that we would go up
But we blew up, blew up, blew up
Fuckin' on a thot on the tour bus
Going out your way for the two of us

[Chorus: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh[Intro: Takeoff]

Reminiscing in my mansion
Thinking back then in the bando I put the dope in her panties
Remember back then on the nawf side
Fifty bands in the suitcase
Free my big brother Kobe
That's the only nigga that threw me the 10k
We were so hot we could sizzle
Now I'm so cold like a blizzard
You think my life was a riddle
Till I send my niggas go and get them
I do this shit for my dawgs
We used to kick doors and all
Now we fuck hoes and ball
Now we fuck hoes and ball
You don't understand it
I took all these chances
That's why I move all my niggas to my fucking mansion
We came up from nothing, jugg a cutie, smoke a onion
We came a long way from the bando smelling like funyuns

Eat out your gut then we turn you to ashes
I'm getting money, my kids gotta eat
Spend fifty thou' on my watch, it ain't cheap
You couldn't walk a mile in my motherfucking feet
Wanna get out so I took the damn plea
I took a chance
You told on your man
Got a bitch up in France
Call my phone when she land
She in love with my cash
Treat that bitch like a nat
Send my shooters attack

Block on fire like a dragon
No question when police be asking
Not having, nigga you fasting
I do this rap shit with passion
Young nigga taking them chances
Running with plays like I’m calling Madden
Remember when I wasn't havin'
Like I got it, I call that shit below average
Now I make a movie Great Gatsby
Remember they didn’t want to call me Takeoff
Like instead of Ali they say Cassius
Now look at them, got 'em embarrassed
Chances, only got one shot, gotta get to the top
And niggas can’t stand it
These bitches gone still drop they panties
All the advances when you get chances
Panic, my pinky ring it do damage
Smell like a pound while on campus
They hated us so they banned us

Spikes on my shoe, yeah I’m Christian Loub, Mike-ing it (spikes)
Where’s Quavo? bitch I’m in another continent“Commando” focuses on Migos' drug dealing days in the hood, and how their goons were comparable to commandos; elite highly trained special forces in the military.Takeoff performs both the hook and the first verse of “Commando”, so you’re hearing his vocals for the majority of the track.[Hook: Takeoff]

She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that’s what applied to me (I’m geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Eat it up - busy bees
Stevie Wonder, play with keys
I told my plug, “Yadda mean,”
That mean, “Come on, with them things,”
I put the work ‘cross seas
Feel like I play with Kareem
I walk around with the nin’
Hundred thousand for the team
I woke up ‘cause I had a dream
I shot at nigga in the spleen
Two niggas looking like Kel and Ken’
Your favorite cousin, dope fiends
I was going on a mission
But I swapped out my hoe for that
Young nigga talking business
Tell that nigga I ain’t here for that
Migo Gang like the Thundercats
And I’m trapping out a Hellcat
Pussy nigga, you a lab rat
Bitch, my diamonds doing jumping jacks
Pull up, gave a Phantom heart attack
Hoe nigga, where your heart is at?
We quick to send ‘em to the cardiac
Cookies and Perc’ – that’s the starter pack
Go to the jeweler; want all of that
Ball on my court, nigga, can’t get the ball back
I be where the money fall at
I take the pot and beat it with a ball bat
You ain’t own it boy, you rented that
If it ain’t broke I ain’t fixing that

She said she want to kick it on the bus
Fucking and sucking up all of us
You know how we do; we just slaughtered her
My jeweler made me look like Slick the Ruler
My bitches bougie, walking with a poodle
When I was little, thought bitches had cooties
Now that I’m grown, got a brick in her coochie
Finesse the plug; I hit him with the whoop-de-whoo
Finessed him right out his shoe
I got some boot in my Margiela boots
Bitches running ‘round my mansion in nude
Bitches stick to me like Gorilla Glue
Smoking on cookies did somebody poo?
You niggas is suckers; you a roody-poo
YRN 2, ball alert, got the news
Sipping on Actavis, like it’s a brew

I throw back a perc’ to call my tensions; we pipe it up in the city
I got your hoe in my DM’s; I got your hoe at my mentions
The plug, he live in my mansion
He got bitches in the kitchen dancing
Then they gone for a month
Then go to trapping all the way in Kansas
Nigga never rode a transit

I be like, “Damn, boy!” what is you thinking?
When I hit Henn' bitch fuck it, I’m swinging
Walk in the Nawf, you know that they banging
(You know I got to pull up on the Nawfside one time)
Dope boy mentality, dope boy mentality
Walk in the kitchen, I make a fatality (finish him)
I feel like Takeoff, yeah we moving to Canada
Cause I still feel like people be after us (12!)
I got the chopper don’t challenge us
White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don’t give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I’m sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it’s recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I’ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don’t imitate, the dab I create
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I’m on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don’t beef with no rapper it’s a money race
It won’t be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
I bought Versace shades from Ray (Ray Charles!)
Put a ‘tato on the K
It gon’ be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight
(We straight!)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table steak and a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It’s a good day today, I’ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don’t speak or say “Hey”
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
Don’t come out the house, you can’t make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I’m cashing out
Used to tell them folks “Put your shit on layaway,”
When it’s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don’t say nothing, Domingo gone get ‘em
After you get ‘em, Domingo gon’ split ‘em
Can’t let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can’t afford a fender bender
Now I’m fucking bitches and I’m Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain’t gonna shoot it with ‘em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain’t talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain’t gon’ give ‘em non’
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas; I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain’t hearing none of that
All them niggas stick ‘em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on ‘em make a nigga do jumping jacks

[Verse 3: Offset]
I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I’m running, I’m not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Muhammad Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I’m a Nawfside lil’ nigga, don’t fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can’t remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap ‘em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deuce deuce in his crotch
Don’t be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage ‘em
Ready for war, ‘case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset; they start to go panic
They know I’m no bullshit; I’m ready to damage
I’m screaming out, “Fuck it,” my cup is still muddy
Don’t kick it with niggas; don’t play “buddy buddy”
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil’ babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It’s cheaper to leave her; I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra

Hit her one time, girl you know that shit over
Kicking Activ, me and Takeoff gon’ toast it

It’s only one god I can fear
Wake up and I look in the mirror
Went and paid ten a piece just for my ear
Living a dream, Yung Rich Nation the gear
All of my niggas been here from the start
When I thought that nobody would never be here
Ain’t talking bout Visine, I see this shit clear
Grandma ain’t here so I shedded some tears
Bitches tryna get up under ya for a mil
Got your own partners tryna kill
Tryna steal, nigga is you for real?
Fuck around and get your cap pealed
Some of my niggas in the bando still

And you know I keep myself protected with the M16
And I'm serving fiends, at ease the police
I do not freeze, I'm from the nawfside I use my two feet
I'm getting rich with my dogs, please do not get involved
All it take is one call, they'll come knock you off
If you're talking 'bout that money baby we gets it all
Touchdown with that dirty bird like I'm Jamal
Plug count the babies when I saw him said awh
Bitch call my phone, I had decline the call
Make like a season, bitch you need to fall
Niggas ain't shit, you need to change your drawers
Broke niggas got a reason to complain baby
I came from nothing rich to spinning like a Tasmanian
You walk around pockets smaller than a Pomeranian
I got owls in my house but I'm not Canadian

I ain't here for the foolishness
Slanging balls like I'm Ludacris
Your jewelry foolery
Your diamonds they ain't fooling me
I'm a boss from the nawf
Don't chase these bitches cause they flawed
I'm in Mansion with two strippers told them call when they off
Hit that bitch with that stick now he eat his food out a straw
Sippin' Actavis, I'm drinking syrup I don't got a cough
Fuck the media, they slandering my name in the blogs
Wikipedia, they got the Migo flow in they thought
These bitches fucking for nothing
These niggas flexing with nothing
That nigga was talkin', we bust him
Fucking that bitch and her cousin
I'm a rich nigga bitch I get more money than your husband
She a rich bitch, nigga you tryna spoil her she ain't want it
Woke up in the morning with two bitches made a porn

She a boss bitch, she pulling up in a Ferrari
Give me back my dab it don't belong to you, I'm sorry

Rest in peace Pistol my nigga not coming back
Smoking on dry cause it come from a laundrymat
I got your bitch sucking me up, no Similac
Chopper nail a nigga like he a thumbin' tack
Call up Rel Money if you want a Migos show
Front end and back end, you sending that
If I take a loss I'ma get it back
They stealing the flow and I'm sick of that
Show me that pink slip cause you rented that
Ain't going back and forth cause I ain't here for that
Yung Rich Nation jeans, my thirty up under that
I've been balling but no Tennessee, plenty racks
They separated from the white and black mansion
No angry white people, we living that
All my bad bitches boss up
Broke bitches need to fall back
Nat nat alley cats
Back of the building fucking on my hoodrats
I'm dabbin' and watchin' like Cinemaxx
Dab on your bitch and I give her a heart attack
You still call it swag, don't call it that
And these niggas know we was the one started that
First I grab the mic, blow a stack, then I fall back
Racks and stacks taller than Shaq, but how good is your pack?
You need to get up and get off your ass and get you a sack
Ain't talking bout money, ain't tryna hear that then fall back

I’m fucking on hoes; I don’t know they name
Hate it or love, bitch, we in the game
My niggas walk in and we shoot up your place
Got a halloween mask and a dirty AK
I fuck on her one time; she want me to stay
I’m pitching hardball like I play for the Braves

Dropping the top off the Benz
We came from the bando community
You know that we started the trend
These niggas copy us, usually
Your bitch want to fuck – she a fan
She got good brain; let her tutor me
This was apart of the plan
Dropping the top in the Lam’
We did this shit for the fam’
These niggas know who I am
Drop the top on the Bentley and it’s over
Hop in the Porsche and pull over
Dropping a four in my soda
I fucked that bitch at the [?]
She piped up, I noticed
I’m having cash and it’s on me
Welcome to the mansion, this a castle
Hop in the pool, it’s deep
Never meet a nigga like me
We had to make it out the streets

Hate it or love it, we gonna’ eat

Light up that cookie, smoke out in public
Double cup, a nigga pouring muddy
It get ugly – hate it or love it
Fuck that broke nigga, don’t fuck with the industry
Literally, I don’ been shot at, like 50 Cent
Fuck niggas having them feminine tendencies, really you niggas just envy me
Niggas be sneak dissing, think they offending me
YRN 2, the rich niggas, they feeling me
I can’t stand broke niggas ‘cause they be killing me
Niggas they hate me ‘cause they can’t get rid of me
I copped the coupe, then I blew out the brain
Don’t know what I’m talking ‘bout? I mean mentally
My diamonds come from Elliot Avianne, you get your diamonds from Tiffany
Hate or love it, my niggas we got the top, my nigga, and we turned nun’ to something
You can talk down all you want to, but you cannot stop my God when them blessings be coming
They don’t want to see me make it
Talking ‘bout Karma when I’m out in Tijuana
My niggas, they keep it one hundred
Hate it or love it, my niggas, they get to the money

Bad bitches, independent, on her business
I pull up in the Phantom and I got ten models with me
Plus ten choppers with me
Sippin' on drink, my doctor with me
Fuck that hoe in a drop top Bentley
Too many shooters, so you cannot get me
Hop in the foreign, and jump out the Bentley
These bitches suckin' on dick so don’t kiss me
Ain’t talkin' money so dismiss me

Aye Offset (yo), aye Takeoff, what's up, unk?

[Bridge: Takeoff]
I'd like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation

Diamond shine came from Africa, shine, shine (Africa)

Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
(If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ya, pitiful) Sad to say

[Verse 1: Quavo & Offset]
First check bought a Audi Coupe
It was black and grey like the Raiders
First check bought a Challenger
It was 10 bands so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset he got me high
That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced (Pussy)

[Hook: Quavo & Offset]
Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya (pitiful, sad to say)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Remember the time, I did my first break and enter?
Me, myself & I ain't had nobody wit me
Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up wit my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me
I know you remember that
6 period plotted on my teacher had to hit for that fundraiser fanny pack
Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that
Call the plug up ask him where he at
I'm celebratin' smokin' back to back
Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said "Damn boy I can catch contact"
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, hit a fat one when we hit for fifty racks

Bettin' poker chips, I ain't playin' Madden (I ain't playin' Madden and I ain't playin' sticks)

Pass chemistry, fuck mathmatics (Fuck mathmatics, I ain't pass school)
My money counter do the adding (Money counter do the rules)

Working my wrist like a ferris wheel, you say this and that while my pockets filled
We don't spare no nigga, cut his head off and show me his real
We got diamonds and gold, ain't no stainless steel
Independant, we didn't take a deal
I know you heard about the fight, I know you heard about the shooting, I know you heard a nigga ruthless
Thirty thousand for a viewing
Bitch you see the dab
10 pairs Margielas, you do the math
When I pull up on Beverly shopping, I pull up in a Phantom, not in a cab
Red bottom drippin' it's a blood bath
Ferragamo, arrested for my dab
Say I'm the dab daddy with my dabbin' ass
Fuck your bitch one time I give her back, here!

Walk in the mall and I dip in Ge'
Swappin', no swappin', no check the tag
Dab daddy so the bitches wanna take selfies
Dicking it up, never not fuck they momma, they call me Melvin
Young rich nigga but they know that we handsome and wealthy
Takeoff is spillin' Actavis on new Margielas
Everywhere I go they call me dab daddy
Dab daddy, got the different, different dab
Flippin' dab like a acrobat
Flippin' it, flippin' it, flippin' 'em
2500 my typa drink, I got expensive habits (Actavis, Actavis, Actavis)
Throw body parts on my Murciélago, pull up like Go Go Gadget
Pull up in valet, David Blaine do magic
Dippin', dabbin' in the Phantom, lookin' at the roof and it's panoramic
Diamonds clear water like they from Atlantic
Dab daddy, I'm the king of the fashion!

[Hook: Quavo]

Hoes calling me the dab daddy

So what part of Atlanta y'all from?
From the north side
Uh, yeah
Every show get crazy and crazy
We growing and growing every, every, every time at a show

[Chorus: Quavo]
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

[Verse 1: Quavo]
We killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands
Mommas and daughters taking a picture with me and they smiling
Charlemagne say the gang Donkey of the Day (Charlamagne?)
Billboard magazine, 45K
Word on the street they say the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it
Check my schedule, itinerary loaded of course
Check my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas is righteous
I don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces
The chains on my neck, I might get arthritis
YRN Tha Album first album going diamond
Got my mama a Benz
Just to show her I'm grinding
Green dots in the pen but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds
Dropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country

[Chorus]
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

[Verse 2: Offset]
Skrrt, cook up
Graat, he shook up
I'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux
My niggas got grenades and bazookas
On the private jet we smoking up in indica
A hundred thousand, got a pick up in India
Headed to locker, we changed the millennium
Thirty thousand for a walk through minimum
Snakes in the grass start spinning out venom
That come with the territory when a nigga winning
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
The blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image
Your CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler
Choppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion
Came from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach
I'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing
And if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys
Never see me lonely, best believe nina on me
Stuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me

[Chorus]
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Pyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up
They looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up
Came in there right and we fucking it up
Jump off the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up
But these niggas still don't get enough
Niggas with attitude don't give a fuck
Young nigga flexing never did a push up
Migo flow everybody wanna look it up
Every ten years it's on my story bro
I bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it
Yo favorite rapper he be biting
When I step in the booth, its a moment of silence
I bet yo bitch she get excited
When I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous
I need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
Can't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin

[Chorus]
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook upMigos gives us the second confirmed song after “One Time” for their debut album “Yung Rich Nation”.https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=156&v=LUiV9TFaaIw[Intro]

Ran from the task force, my lifestyle like a rodeo horse
Had a dream in a porsche then I woke up and had to go to court
Got a lawyer, dropped the cases, now you see me on the pages
XXL magazine, December issue cover Fader
They sayin' Migos better than the Beatles
Paul McCartney, I would like to meet him
Young niggas from the Northside with Lyor Cohen havin' brunch meetings
Huncho, where the fam?, I got to feed 'em, private jet in the six seater
Quavo livin' legend, Elvis, that's why I pull up Lincoln Continental, gone!

Street nigga just want a Beamer
On the Northside, police givin' subpenea's
Pistol in the locker, Gilbert Arenas
Grandma was a sacrifice, can't forget
We can see the fuck shit and we with it
Trappin' out the bando, behind the door was a semi
Real got the squad, Quavo whip it scientific
Juggin' iPhones, so we made a half a ticket
Real street nigga sacrifice
And you in the trap, watch out for the mice
Please don't get it twisted, we on the mic
Choppas eat you niggas like a termite
Bloody money turn to clean money
Fiend money that got bean money
I seen money and I dream money
Listerine wash it, I clean money

No re in the sacrifice, I pull up in the Lamborghini, turn on the lights
Gotta thank god for my life, shit that happen over night
Well respected, Migos Gang, we rep this worldwide, takin' nine hour flights
When you a young rich nigga, you do what you like
Want a feature, nigga gotta pay the price
Pourin' act in the cream soda, fuck the sprite
Cut the lights off and in the club, my diamonds bright
In the kitchen with the egg beater, hop in the Lamborghini, that's a two seater
Work come from Columbia, name it Catalina
Might just take a trip, just go to Geneva

Migo N.W.A nigga

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Woke up quick at about noon, just thought that I had to be on the north soon
Hop in my Bimmer to see my moms, my mom started trippin' 'bout my stinkin ass bong
Stopped at the gas station, get it pumped by the bums
See some niggas I ain't like where I came from
I grabbed my Glock then I dialed one number
Tell my brother that I'm slipping and I'm in trouble
So the nigga I don't like made a move to the right
I grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight
The nigga to the left told me put the gun down
BOW one round, Uh, its going down
I ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit
My migos pull up with macs and sticks
Rel hopped out and let 2 shots off
Then I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law
I rolled down the window, it's the officer
Put his nose in my car, and say he smell the herb
He opened up the door and asked me can he search?
Hell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?
I'm worth a million

High Speed chase going down 29
Mama on my line sayin' I'm on Fox 5
I said "you sure Ma?" she said "baby it's live"
I said "Fuck twelve" turn up the alpine
Rockin' down Boggs Road seen a punk ass busta
Got the 38 on me but this bitch kinda rusty
Fuck it i'ma shoot it, if it jam then I'm running
BOW BOW BOW BOW, crumping must be from Oakland
I ran through the cut, 12 chasin' me
Smoking on gas got the best of me
He getting so close, bout to tackle me
I turned around and emptied the clip, get from round me
It's fucked up, niggas in the hood they killing each other
And most of us got single parents, only a mother
Niggas in the kitchen whipping chickens, tryna get butter
Police on my ass cause the Budniks on the Cutlass
Police pull me over got the mac in the back
Wait till he get up out the car and hit the gas
High speed chase down 29
And if I get caught I'm gettin' a lifetime

Once upon a time not long ago
3 amigos by the name of Offset Takeoff Quavo
Stayed on the north side, thats where anything goes
And if a nigga disrespect, he meet the funeral home
Wake up in the morning, thank him cause it's me that he chose
Migo Jerz at the bando with a fork in a bowl
My nigga called me at the park and said its getting too deep
Jumped in my R8 with ostrich seats and hit the streets
Ridin' down club drive feeling myself
I know the block is hot, I'm screaming fuck 12 sparking a spliff
My conscious telling me you tripping Takeoff think I see 12
Damn I shouldn't of served that nigga at the Shell
Now lemme tell you a riddle
Mirror mirror on the wall, what would you do if police told you pull over your car?
Mirror, when do you picture the Migos falling off?
The mirror said you stupid boy, don't ask that question at all
I see red and white blue lights as I look in my rear
Put the gas out, it's Friday and it's smokey in here
Fuck another high speed chase, that's when the hemi kick in
Forgive me for my sins, I ain't going back to the pen

Gave my brothers no bond and said they a flight risk
They recordin', reportin', Fox 5 on my dick
I just gave them information 'bout my new bitch

No information no participatin', ain't no conversation
They hatin' I made it, speculatin'
Takin' 'bout how many drugs in that vacant

She riding on Toyota, have you ever been on a Lear?
A California foreign baby, something you can barely steer
Wait hold up, that's something you can't afford
You say you want that for real, well I can lease that Porsche of course
Take her to the mall, shutdown your favorite store
Have her walking out with bags, she don't wanna shop no more
Damn, Dolce Gabbana's, Alexander McQueen, she want red bottoms
This bitch she say she want her hair just like Rihanna's
And she know daddy money longer then Rapunzel
My diamonds stone cold she thinks she want a stunner

You know I don't want nothing but some penetration
So hit me later, tell me what's the situation
You know It's nothing
She said she never been to Atlanta now she coming
Flying from a foreign country, trying to get into something
Really she don't know nothing, can't play a player
Baby girl I want you on the northside, welcome to my world
Then why the hell she so mad then
She ain't got nothing but a little back end
She hop in the front of the Bentley coupe
And she give me brain that's frontin'
Her phone ring, she hop out my Bentley like her grandmama was calling
I ain't seen her since then, and she still keep calling
Can't play a player
They say she got a man, keep her shopping out on Rodeo
Imma let him do it, I ain't gonna spoil her, I'm a player

Gotta fit you in my busy schedule
I can help you get your life together, I'm flyer than a feather
In any weather, I'm a player
We can swap these bitches out nigga and trade them
I've never been the cuffing type, I'm no lifesaver
I put a hole in your nigga, he like a bagel

Diamonds build our temperature up, fucking run it to the closet
Chopper make you do whatever I say niggas call me Simon
Money growing like Pinocchio, nigga, but I ain’t lying
Most of these bitches ain’t mine, I fuck them then move down the line
See that cocaina gon’ bring you to crime
And that cocaina gon’ start bringing the fire
But get caught with that cocaina get time
You been fucking up and run at the wrong time
It can be a crumb they gon’ charge you like it’s a dime
Looking at my neck and wrist like why I can’t shine
Looking at the i8 like why can’t I ride?
Cocaina come out the boat and it’s certified

[Intro]
Yung Rich Nation!
Migo!
This what they been waiting for...

[Hook: Quavo]
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys I am dealing
Same niggas that you're fearing, same niggas that I live with
Couple m's in the attic, ain't gotta count it every day 'cuz I'm havin'
Got the fish in the water, I'm slabbin'
Count up the extras, I'm dabbin'
Eighteen hours land in Moscow, what the hell them niggas doin' in Moscow?
Yung Rich Nation, Migo gang now, havin' international fame now
She don't speak no English, she wanna meet me, her daddy the plug out in Argentina
She try to drink that liquid in the glass, told her "baby girl, it's not tequila"
In Miami I hit the doughnut in traffic in the Lamborghini two seater
Your ho fly, in town, I take her to the telly, I fuck her one time and I leave her

[Hook: Quavo]
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk

'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk

[Verse 2: Offset]
I got the blues...
Used to be kickin' them doors in my Jordans, I walk in the club with my Lous (Louboutins)
Now we fuck bitches by two
Dropped out of school, they said we was fools, them diamonds looking like a fool
Mansion, twenty five rooms, we got bananas, baboons
Young niggas we brought the trap...back
We gave you, so fuck it, we want it back
Don't do that, nigga, boy, we on that
Whippin' and flippin', you cloned that
I'm not going back and forth, she knew it was a 'Rari when she seen the horse
Trappin' babies and we never abort
Migo gang we established on the north
We had the bando beating like a pulse
I wanted some money, I jumped off the porch
Hot nigga so I keep me a torch
I will burn a nigga, put that on my lil' boy

[Hook: Quavo]
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Call it trap funk 'cuz we having gas bags, and we put the fork in the trap
Same keys you're here playing on the piano, I got them wrapped up in saran wrap
Got a plug out in Moscow with the act
And don't tell them too much information they rats
Baby bottle, but no Rugrat
Niggas is old hundreds, call them Thunder Cats
Young nigga be dabbin', hittin' the foam with the spatula
Dab daddy, pull up, these bitches suck me like Dracula
Diamonds pull up, my jeweler from Canada
You niggas still bubblegum wrapping 'cuz you niggas amateurs (pitiful)
Christian Louboutins, a walking mannequin, my balmains full of blue Benjamins
Don't drink that shit just to be cool, I only sip Actavis 'cuz it's my medicine
They put me on the news, they tryna embarass me
Got the Migos looking like we some terrorists
Taking hits, gotta run with the punches
My momma told me it's just a form of jealousy

[Hook: Quavo]
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk

[Hook: Quavo]
Trap out the bando, I really did it

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Talk to em' Quavo
Takin' back the streets you know I own
Trap and cap when momma ain't at home
When she cook up the dope call it Nia Long
Kickin' dough was my specialty
Mama told me she gon' get at me
But I was worried 'bout the police
Runnin' from 12 in a Gucci fleece
It's a great feeling that they notice me
Came from bando to mansion to TV screen
No more trappin' no more ReNeNe
Now it's double XL Migo magazine
Don't get me wrong, I keep the magazine
Now I'm the last don, shout out to Master P
I pray to lord, devil don't tackle me
What a great feelin' million dollar me

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Trapped out the bando I really did it
Water whippin' chickens, all these cameras in the kitchen
Breakin' in the mitten, my nigga was sellin' Whitney
Niggas come and get it cause I got a lower ticket
What a fucking feeling giving money to the children
Bentley Mulsanne pulling up in project buildings
Break niggas neck, walkin' in the chinchilla
My Giuessepe steppers same ones in thriller
These niggas they hate me, but they can't defeat me, I know why they envy me
What a feeling, how I got a hundred million all in cash and you niggas just look at me
VVSing for from my jeweler out in Cuba
I see fugazi diamonds on your Cuban link, 100,000, money nigga ain't nothin' to me
Take that bitch make her work for me, wanna fuck on the shower pole? Mimi

[Hook: Quavo]

Make my momma smile

Now I got recognition
Same people doubted see me on television (TV)
Pocket watching on a nigga cheque
Recognize a nigga Rolex
17 years old nigga kicking doors
Couldn't even vote yet
Meditation of the mind was the greatest thing a nigga found
They recognize a nigga sound
And we didn't let the world down
Started with a brick turned it to a foundation
Turn the foundation to an empire
I'm the founder of Yung Rich Nation
And I still get recognized by my old patients
With a snaggle tooth smile, he said he happy that I made it

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
If I got the feeling that I weren't recognized
I know I'd still be recognized in momma's eyes
I'm in the trench coat for the skies
I keep the .45 on my waistline
Shoot your block down with the Glock like a alpine
Fuck it shoot the club up call me Shyne
These Balmains no Calvin Kleins
Flood my neck with that gold like Busta Rhymes
That Migos on the billboard worldwide we recognized
A lot of these niggas wanna be recognized
But get caught jammed up not gonna do the time
I know some niggas they got acquitted
And they didn't want tell and get crucified
I'm smoking on OG, it ease my mind
Need some Visine cause I got the red eyes
Ain't thinking 'bout a bitch I'm getting money cause these bitches come and go like red eyes
Now I'm recognized taking trips in my lamb I own it no enterprise
Looking at niggas can't be mad at niggas cause nigga just want to be recognized

[Verse 3: Offset]
Momma said recognize God
I recognized then my momma had pain in her eyes
So I walked through the shadow, the valley of death
I'm addicted to drank and I can't even help it (lean, lean, drank, drank)
Pussy nigga taking selfies
Ask me for money I told that nigga no he go round the hood saying I'm selfish (huh?)
That's the reason that I left him
Your momma keep calling say help
She didn't recognized you was a failure
I wanted to be recognized
Went to the mall and bought me a 10 and told the school it caught me five
My OG taught me to be wise
Thanking the lord cause I'm recognized
VH1 you can go see it live
Now you see me shining now you want to ride (Skrrr)
They finally recognized
They copy the way we rhyme

It's been a long time coming
From young niggas to young rich niggas
It's DJ Durel and I'd like to welcome you to Rich Nigga Timeline

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch the leakin' (ba-bow)
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget (nah, for real)
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about? (Shit)
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot boy, so you know I gotta stay low (hot)
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet (vet)
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check (do it)
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out "Free Actavis"
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T, pity the fool
Master P, No Limit money, bando jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got Playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me 'til a nigga be cumming

[Chorus: Quavo]
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

[Verse 2: Offset]
When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

[Chorus: Quavo]
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

[Chorus: Quavo]
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the countryThis is the intro song of the Migos Rich Nigga Timeline Mixtape, produced by Mario.[Hook: Quavo]
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time I turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Free my nigga Westside, locked up to this day
R.I.P. my migo P, my nigga dead in the grave
And I dare a fuck nigga come and try me today
Abracadabra his face
Quavo the magician, the pack gone it's missin'
I got a ho and she got a ho and now they both kissin'
Do you remember, the life I was livin'?
I'm callin' the plug, I'm juugin' up pounds, I'm breakin' down midget
I got the birds, pigeons
They know who the fuck run the city (Nawfside!)
I might pull up with that chopper and extensions
I just let it off, I empty about 50
Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis" (mama)
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity" (infinity)
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown
'Til I took your bitch, drop her off right there by Morris Brown
Used to cook up bricks 'til I turned that shit to an extra now
I got the magic stick, feelin' like Criss Angel, bitch
I disappear bricks

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 2: Offset]
17 stackin' and countin', 18 I ran from the bounty
You niggas is softer than Bounty, my nigga got 15, free Ronny
Check out my bio, plenty felonies, known for countin' up broccoli
Known for stackin' up celery, you niggas ain't even a vet to me
'Member the days? Run in your house like a raid
Young nigga tryna get paid
Pistol to his face, give him a shave
Never selfish, all the money I gave
Never change, all the money I make
1 baby, all these bitches I laid
2 guns, nigga, never afraid
Migos the army I'm never gon' trade
Set-Set hit a 20 band juug
He helped the hood, everybody was good
I'm white like a tiger and I got the wood
My niggas on go like Nike, they gon' do it
These niggas wonderin', like how did we do it?
Water diamonds on my neck look like fluid
I'm from the Zone 3 if you niggas ain't knew it
I'm throwin' up the north cause that is my hood
Locked up, mama couldn't get me out
Called my nigga Bookie, he got me out
KK got my back, ain't no doubt
Player made, free my bro, let him out
This shit is crazy, shout out mama house
Don't come to my trap and you unannounced
21 Challenger mounted up
Doin' phones, fucked your credit up
When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run
I didn't know if I was comin' home
19, I was on my own
My grandma died, cancer on her bones
I ran in houses just to buy some Foams
You can hear the pain in my voice on my songs

[Hook: Quavo]
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
13 I got my first halftime
14, broke in the club for an Alpine
15 I got my first Glock 9
It was rusty but it still'd bust a nigga
I was lil' nephew, they wasn't gon' touch a nigga
If I did, my uncles'll bust a nigga
Migo gang, they couldn't fuck with a nigga
Started beefin' with some sucka niggas
Belushi's right there up on Club Drive
It's was y'all side versus Nawfside
Knocked a couple niggas out a couple times
Got in shootouts with niggas a hundred times
Come to your party, we fuckin' it up
Young niggas, we never gave a fuck
Young niggas, 10, 12, 13, on go with a finger point
A lot of squads start poppin' up
Screamin' shit that we ain't heard of
Migos pull up at your residence
Here comes the issue, "it wasn't us, bruh"
We know you flexin', got the information
So you still gon' get hit with the uppercut
Beat a nigga to a puddle, nigga snitchin'
Now we runnin' from the task force
Niggas was kickin' in doors, takin' flat screens and all the gold
Never got it and I sat on it, nigga, everything I got was sold
Apple Mac, juugin' laptops
Knock in your door, take your lil' brother's Xbox
Migo Jerz stand around the curb
Used to match up in the hotbox
Hit a juug for some True Religions
And some Robin Denims in a public community
My brother's keepers, Migo we got unity
Bout to fire up at the park right on Harrington
To the bando, you see niggas gamblin'
Hit a kick door my niggas be ramblin'
I got a bag on my back like I'm Santa Claus
Finnesse a nigga, Papa John's up in Panama

[Hook: Quavo]
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold

Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mineSecond track of Migos' Rich Nigga Timeline.This track is mainly talking about Migos and their journeys on the way to getting rich.[Chorus: Quavo]
Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That’s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh
(Hit it!) When a nigga hit the plug
When I nigga hit the trap and I hit 'em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh (skrrt)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Hit it, hit it, man I’m tryna stretch it to a whole fifty
Hit the juug, man I’m tryna put you niggas on if you with it
You niggas in your own lane, Migo gang in a division
Hit the pot just for the extras, abracadabra it’s missing
Hit the pot, hit it, hit it, hit it, make 'em take that like Diddy
Fuck fuck nigga talking, pull up on the block with extensions
Look up the statistics, I’m worth a million
I might pull up in the coupe and hurt your feelings
If you shooting at a nigga, better hit him
'Cause you never know, he could come back and hit you

[Chorus: Quavo]

Beat 'em with it, I'ma go and beat 'em with it
I won’t ever leave it in her
Bullets hit the Sprinter, you sweeter than a cinnamon
I’m checking my agenda, you niggas acting feminine
Had enough to pay my dividends, Migos I’m a citizen
It was evident we had to stay passionate
Pissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate
Hit 'em with the tackle
Pull out the chopper, not fronting I’ll rush 'em
Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel
I am not a mason but I’m rocking Margiella’s
Higher than a motherfucker, just like a propeller
I’m riding in the Mulsanne, Bentley got umbrellas
My plug’s too far so I tell a nigga mail 'em

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Nigga talking crazy like he want to buck
Hit him with the uppercut, I make him knuckle up
Pull up in the Lamborghini Murcielago to
Make your bitch buckle up, turn me up
Sipping on poison ivy, but nigga check my double cup
My brothers know Isley, tweety bird tweeting in my Bentley truck
Nigga talking bout a check then Imma run it up
Shots fired at my sprinter bus, bap bap bap, graow
Nobody got hit, it was ten of us
Touch down at Coachella and they pulling up
Pick up the vector, then I point it up
Start busting, ain’t no need to load it
I hit the gas, take out their expedition truck

[Chorus: Quavo]

Pockets on swole, I did it to the hundo breakin' that bowl
Got to buy 'em, when I buy 'em, get the bricks, I circumcise 'em
I got so many jewels on a nigga, I say l'chaim
Feelin' like the Koreans in Menace to Society
Tellin' them niggas to hurry and buy 'em
Stop tryna walk up on me with them two lil zips don’t wanna buy 'em
Next time he walk up in my trap

And if it ain't right I'm denyin' it
I'm 'bout the action, 'bout that violence
And no it ain't no rocket science
Get that pound and then you divide it
Weigh it up on the scale and count, slide it
Point 5 'em, I move in silence
I bought it, it wasn't an issue
Nigga I got 50 thousand dollars worth in tennis shoes
You gotta take an L if you want a fuckin' W
I started in a Super 8, I'm trappin' out the W
Mortal Kombat, fatality, I finish you
Niggas gonna hate on you, can you take the ridicule?
Got a hundred thousand dollars stashed up in the intertube
Got my bitches in the kitchen whippin' up a new

Benjamin is my itinerary
That nigga trappin' in December

When the plug make the call, know that I can move the ball
Nigga can you flip it all, can you make a fifty ball
In the streets I’m a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Selling rolls, no Quan, Roll Latifah said it all
Got to have a gas mask in the kitchen cause I cough
Move the work out to Memphis so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know that you false
Rick Ross ain’t the only nigga in the world boss
Put the Forgi’s on the old school, riding Chevy T-top
When a nigga walk up on me, freeze him like a freeze pop
Feeling like a DJ, hit em with the rerock
Feeling like I’m LOX nigga rerock on the D-block
Fucking with the Chi-town niggas out in O-block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on your block
Nigga just was cooking, that’s the reason why the stove hot
Seeing money, in my dreams I had a bank roll knot

I’m a criminal, I got to move my operation
You don’t got the money on time, my nigga what’s your occupation
I played em with the muslim, we came up with the [?]
We would never be in cases, never in investigations
Told em As-salamu alaykum cause my niggas kept it sacred
I’m feeling like Big Meech I got a hundred million in my vases
I got GD in my vessel, pistol popping like it’s kettle
I can make 100 thousand dollars with no effort
Got a thousand niggas with me, they looking for you like bounties
Imma put a tax on the gas moving out the county
Sipping Actavis, got me drowsy, trapping, capping, Maui Waui
I got bricks up in the U-haul, I got workers in the mountains
How fast can you count it, my nigga I don’t need to count it
You a cannibal, run off with the pack, eat em like animals
Bricks up in Florida, they calling me a Seminole
I know how to move em, Michael Jackson, I’m a smooth criminal

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Drinking on Activis, whip the work then I’m packing it
100K in the attic, I got the bricks in the cabinet
Though the work is immaculate, I be trapping and dabbing it
On the island I’m cooling it, had the kush in my Loubotins
That's an intruder in the window, I’m shooting it then fly to Bermuda
Pull up with choppers with the coolers in it
I’m trapping, got a half a bag but don’t know what to do with it
Fuck a milli, bet a thou'll make your bitch get loose with it
Selling out arenas, fuck a nigga’s city up, we used to it
They never seen 100 thousand cause you niggas new to it
QC that’s the label got a solid foundation
My nigga trapping out vacants, we smoking gas like Jamaica
Black and white Bentley Musalnne but I am not racist
Traveling around the world to go get Benjamin faces
If you ain’t talking bout money then I get aggravated
Get up out my face if you ain’t talking Benjamin Faces
Taking trips across the nation

[Chorus: Quavo]
Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move

She know I got millions, no need to lie
Tattoo on her booty is a butterfly

Wanna take her home, when I get in my room, when I get the pussy, I'mma dive in it
She make me wanna have a million babies, when she poppin' the booty, hop-scotchin' it
I reach in my pocket, I slap her on the ass, told her she better not stop poppin' it
Everybody know that she a cutie
You keep spendin' money, she make you foolish
But look at me, Young Quavo, I'mma do it
She poppin' it on me, she make me lose it

Freaky deaky, pussy drippin', leakin'
White girls, I got jungle fever
Her booty jumpin', every beat out the speaker
Hit her one time, then I leave with the leader
Run around, jump up and down like a pogo
IPhone my camera, we might make a porno
I had to pipe her up, my game for a makeover
Private jet to LA, we don't do layovers
Ooo, Oh, piercings in the nipples, piercings in the dimples, pop it like a pimple
She nasty, bet you didn't know her daddy a pastor, laughter
She in my trap while she poppin' the castle
Speed it up, then she go slow
Grippin' that pussy, do the tootsie roll
She go harder than the concrete
Italian tailor, Givenchy
Money longer than a bungy
All this damn gold like a treasury
Lick on me like I am licorice

Her pussy wet when she get on that percocet
She looked at my hand, saw it full of bands
Put a little bit, bitch pop that
I'm throwin' cash, cash, all niggas see is ass
It must be an ass attack
Do you want some of these old hundreds baby?
I'm talkin' older than Thundercats
She shakin', she know her ass fat
Got me thinkin' where is her momma at
All the bitches starin' at you in the club
'Cause they know that you be poppin' that
She breakin' it, makin' the club shake
She done gave the old man a heart attack
She shakin' like Shakira, look in the mirror
No ass shots, her booty real
She poppin' her nigga no Activis seal

You know I'm a bachelor
Got your bitches workin', calling me master
Came from the bottom and now I got guala
Turn the page, my nigga, we on the next chapter
Trapper turned rapper
Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor
Flippin' your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas
Your ho was creeping like tarantulas
Migos we don't like the cameras
We find out that we can make millions with it
So we started flexin' like bachelors
Came from stashing money in the ceilin'
Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?
Came from kicking doors, juugin' plug for the bows
And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs
I don't see the millions that you pursuin'
Statistics in black and white, what is you doin'?
Top the charts every time we drop a new one

Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager
Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders
My niggas on top of the mountain, no Grand Canyon
Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance
Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis
Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet
I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit
I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat
I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback
Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back
Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?

Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper
Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
Got that price on your head, nigga like a alopecia
I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account
From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple
I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle
Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper
Just because you got a milli, you are not a bachelor

[Hook: Quavo]
Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera (nah!)
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors[Hook: Quavo]
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (Naw forreal)
Take a look at my life back then, trap season (Naw forreal)
When you make it, everybody think that it's easy (Naw forreal)
My family need me (Naw forreal, forreal)
My squad let me lead 'em (Naw forreal, forreal)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Get this bitch ass nigga off of from 'round me, Naw forreal
I had the plug with the molly and the xans in a marijuana field
Want to live the Migo life? It's hard to live
Want to walk in my shoes? That is hard to fill
Naw forreal, man you know that we made a mil'
Independent, I cease and desist your deal
You niggas trippin' cause you out of business
And we came in the game so fast, we're professionals
Started doin' shows at Mansion and Obsessions
You seen it, everybody know, they witnessed
Naw forreal, R.I.P. my nigga Pistol P
I know he send a nigga down blessings
Now I wanna walk around on the north
Nigga gotta keep the mac chicken

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
Naw forreal, really had to sit down and do some time
Naw forreal, young rich nigga got rich off of a halftime
The block be beatin' like Alpine, nah forreal, 200 for the Act line
Stand at the stove, whip a slab, that's a cookie slab
Police tried to get me for a gang, I had an alibi
Nah, fuck niggas you a lie
Rel hit a jug Willie Mac found a nine
Forreal we were hot boys
Put the gun up in your mouth just like a Altoids
Chopper start snappin', gotta be a damn poet
We ain't holdin' no lean, go ahead and pour it
Skinny tires on the rari' lookin' bow legged
I'm a bachelor, I live in a mansion that's gated
44 to say bow!

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Naw forreal, pints double sealed
And the OG gas bag come vacuum sealed
Remember kickin' in your door takin' flats
And the door stickin' out at my grandma crib
Trap on the block whether rain, sleet, or snow
Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Got excited when I seen a half a mil'
I was prayin' just to get a record deal
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems
It's a lot of shit that I regret I did
Can't let negativity get to me
I take a private jet to Sicily
So you the grinch who stole Christmas
I got the OG gas bag Christmas tree

Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Remember the days with the pocket rockets
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
It’s a million dollars in the corner pocket
I just share the rock like I’m John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got 'stendos on their guns, they go up out it
Ain’t no need to talk about it
Megaton trucks, it don’t weigh enough
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks
QC the label got mega bucks
Gas off in the back of the spinner bus
Say that you trapping, really you got touch and bust
This is the life of the Hefty bags
You know that them ounces don’t weigh enough

[Chorus: Quavo]
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it

You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it

They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I came a long way from dropping the fishes
Finessing the plug for his riches
Wake up in the morning, I go grab the spatula
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued
Double cup, a nigga still be sipping
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finland
I trap out the bando, don’t trap out the trap house
And whatever you with, we with it
Came a long way from that midget
Money taller than a midget
I keep the mac like a midget
Mama we made us a milli, we did it
Fuck the negativity, fuck the critics

[Chorus: Quavo]
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it

Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

[Verse 3: Offset]
They hate that that money start coming in
And I be too fresh, I call it double mints
I was on the block, you was on punishment
Giuseppe stepping, and my diamonds they compliment
QC my label, and that’s my establishment
Supercharge my Bentley, I call it Clark Kent
Me and my niggas spread the butter, margarine
Marvin the Martian, got Raris, I cut off the engines, now park it
You can catch a bullet in your carcass
100 band juug, and you wasn’t a part
I took the plug off and we had a departure
You telling a story bout me, I’m the author
These bitches be choosing, they digging my posture
Whipping babies, I’m not talking bout toddlers
Similac in on these baby bottles
Little babies get stepped on they call me stepfather

[Chorus: Quavo]
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches

Wake up in the morning,  gotta thank God
Walking out the bando with a .45
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound
It's just another day on the Nawfside
I'm for real, nigga, you can ask about us, nigga
We earn stripes on the Nawfside
Just another day, just another day
Just another day on the North
Real talk, nigga
I know niggas took a loss, nigga
On the Nawfside, it's just another day on the Nawfside
On the North, it's just another day on the Nawfside

[Verse 1: Quavo]
It's just another day, what is a day on the north?
Wake up in the morning, they kick in the door
We looking for money, we looking for gold
My niggas 100, my niggas on go
My niggas is trapping, dapping, what is you having?
Run with the sack and I go hit the hole
They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
I run the game
Look at my house, take a look at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day
I play the game like a game of spades
And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Nigga, they bucking, they rubbing, they sacking
Taking the pounds and breaking them down
What a beautiful day, my AK came equipped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
Just another day on the Nawfside rollin' (rolling)
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac all eyez on me (2Pac)
My young nigga hit a 100 band jugg in the club it was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side
Gwinnett County patrolling

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Trapping on Club Drive, Migos the Army got Mob ties
We hit the ground, we had to do time
Kick in the door a million times
My nigga Westside he had to do five
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You gotta survive ,the streets will eat you alive
They say we wear make up, but that was a lie
Broke in them houses, no burglar bars
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard
I got a bulldog and it's gonna bark
You niggas is bitches, you wear leotards
Bitches they mad cause I broke their heart
Needed college, I didn't go to Clark
Beating the pot like it's martial arts

[Hook]The 12th song on Rich Nigga Timeline. “Nawfside” refers to Gwinnett County, particularly Norcross, GA. Migos grew up here and are very well respected.[Hook: Quavo]
You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, I can not trust them
Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Let me tell you a story
'Bout this lil' bitch named Tamara
She'll let you smash for sure today
And then smash your partner tomorrow
She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars
Everybody know lil' mama on go
Everybody call her hundred gobbler
Got hoes on hoes like a roster
Is it because of my posture?
But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father
She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket
And break your wallet, and you know she got it
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket
You can not play me
You know you're too wishy washy
Kick her out the house politely
We noticed you was too excited
No we not going for it, no we not going
You're too wishy washy lil' bitch and you know it
Ain't got time for a kid, the lil' bitch at the front door

[Hook: Quavo]
You know these hoes wishy washy

Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy

[Verse 2: Offset]
These hoes wishy washy
Ain't no doubt about it
Quick to put your finger in a young nigga's wallet
And I know you fuckin' my partner
Quick to fuck a nigga for a couple hunna
High class pimpin' these niggas, she got the formula
Suckin' my anaconda, got the flower aroma
And on my mama I'm not fuckin' these bitches without a condom
Wishy washy
Cut these bitches off like hibachi
I'm fuckin' her and her whole posse
If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit
She givin' up her pussy for the profit
Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it
She really wanna be on red carpets
These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible
Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach
These bitches are funny
They're tryna take a nigga's money
I don't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing
Up to par, my swag from London
These bitches bad, ain't worth nothin'
I'm just sayin', I can see your plan
You wanna get married to a rich man

[Hook: Quavo]
You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I can't fuck with you bitches, you wishy washy
Neiman Marcus shoppin', she want me to spoil her rotten
But I know that she's plottin' mama said don't trust nobody
This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli
I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better
That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas
Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She askin' me where my umbrella
Fox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla
Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand
She know how to work the pots and pans
She watchin' me like I'm on demand
She the bomb, Osama Bin (Osama Bin Laden!)

[Hook: Quavo]
You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet

Baby I'm on the road
But it's all good, though
I love you, love you, I'ma call right back
That boy Cas
But it's all good, all good

[Pre-Chorus: Takeoff]
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
'Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking 'bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking 'bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
'Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

[Chorus: Takeoff]
When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Okay, I be on a private jet to Portuguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain't never seen
The OGs keep telling me "boy, you gon' make history"
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man, we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes, I make her panties leak
She still probably won't believe, so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it's all good though

[Chorus: Takeoff]
When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though

Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo talk to 'em, ooh
You know you're shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my God what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I'm a young nigga, ain't used to relations
So you know I ain't patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don't eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That's my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire

[Pre-Chorus: Takeoff]
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'

[Verse 3: Offset]
I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I'm a player
I'm not used to cuffing the women but I'm gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain't no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil' mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I'm kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though

[Pre-Chorus: Takeoff]
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'

Wanna take her to my room, take her
Can I take you to my room?
I got a big house, I live in a mansion
I got a lake you can canoe
Every time she see the jewels
She say that it scaring her like peek-a-boo
I take her, go dab in the mall
She walking out, Christian Louboutin shoes
Came from 100 bands in the trap house
To making millions on the mic now
Remember the days in the bando
Used to pull up, it look like the white house
She act just like me and she humble
She look like her mama
She can get anything from me, keep the hunnas
But a nigga gotta get the commas
Remember the days, surprise on your birthday
Got you the H3 Hummer
Now we on the phone and she on the road
She gonna go get the blue bundle
I know that she loyal, know that she loyal
Know I gotta go spoil her, gotta go spoil her

Wanna ride like Sequoia

Hey girl, look at you
Make a nigga wanna give you the blue
I'm likin' the way you move
Austin Powers, baby groove
Take you to Montreal, Canada
Let you dive off in my 50 feet pool
All y'all vehicles old
Baby girl want some new
She say she want the 2014 Bentley
Baby girl, what you gon' do?
Is it me, is it me? No I think it's you
No offense to you, but I ain't spendin' my money on you
She said "no, baby don't go"
But I ain't spent my money on a bitch since 1994

Louboutin pennies cost a pretty penny
My bitch is so bad like I Dream of Jeannie
Phantom pulling up, after that Lamborghinis
Magically takin' your bitch, Houdini
I call her my chef, order linguini
I take her, debate her, I trade her, I might hit her later
My niggas bust her open like a baker
I fucked her, I skeeted all over her naval
I call my partner, pass her to my neighbor
I do not trust her, she suckin' the plastic
I beat it, I killed it, put it in a casket
She the talk of the trenchez, they know that she nasty
Know that she ratchet and she is not classy
I'm cool on her
I'll send her right back, give me this girl
You can have your ho

Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Got to survive, the struggle
I had to get my money cause I ain’t have no muscle
My squad gon ride that’s because I trust em
If he want to die, know my squad gon bust him
If they ain’t with us then my nigga fuck em
It’s a struggle in my hood, blue Benjamins, I touch em
RIP to Mike Brown, I heard my nigga fuck with us
Middle finger to the police dare them niggas fuck with us (Fuck 12!)
I got all these chains, I’m representing slavery
Only listen to my god and mama, that’s who made me
When my brother [?] called my phone, that shit was crazy
RIP my brother Pistol Pete, let em know we made it
Mama told me that she can’t visit me in the pen
She want to break me out and I can’t see her going in
I swear to god you might ain't seen it
But if you been through the struggle I know you feel this

[Chorus: Quavo]
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
See the struggle is a motherfucker
Nigga tryna hit me for my chain, but I ain’t gon let him touch it
Go to any state, walk through your hood and I ain’t got to tuck em
Swear to god if you touch my brother I ain’t gon hesitate to bust ya
Niggas see you getting money, plotting, tryna take it from ya
It’ll hurt you if you know your right hand man, he telling on you
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana
OutKast in my Backwood, young nigga smoking on Stankonia
Remember plugging up that George Foreman
Early in the morning eat leftovers
I had to warm it, now a young nigga eat steak and shrimp at Benihanas
I remember ten piece chicken nuggets from McDonalds
I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand solid, never let another nigga take it from you
I told you mama, now you got that mansion that you wanted
I came a long way from renting the Audi, now I own it
Rest in peace Ree-Ree and Pistol Pete, the top is lonely

[Chorus: Quavo]
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

[Verse 3: Offset]
First free my brother, we used to build the mansions in the house with covers
He used to beat me, told me nigga get some muscle
If you can’t beat em then you gonna have to bust em
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a strap said I wasn’t going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the sack then my niggas kidnap, call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kickin' in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that’s the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed
Givenchy my toe, I came out that bowl, I lived on the stove

[Chorus: Quavo]
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle[Intro: Takeoff]
My weed from Jamaica, my money older than Sega
Bust it open, then wait up, tell m, work out, then re-up

[Hook: Takeoff]
My diamonds sparkling, I be like the sargent
Pull up in the Astin Martin, leave in a Burperry carpet
Migo the label, but no no playing with paper
My shirt tiger striped, my shoes aligater
With the plug, never see it
Wip them chickens and pidgens, cokina and midgets, touch it, I flip it


[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I remembered in school, teacher talkin bout history
I was tryna make history, up in that house in Beverly
I just called my jeweller, tell him bring me my rolly
In that muscle car, 12 pull me over for flexin

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I got sweet and sour chicken, lemon, go get me some beef
I got soldiers in the streets, I'm commander and chief
When the Js hit the dope, I bet those nose bleed
I got a plug from Mixico, and one plug that’s chinese
Bad bitch on my team, do whatever I please
Thick thais, brown eyes, she finesse you with eze
Think the jeweller got me sick, a chew, I sneez
Someone get me a key, I'll just rest in peace
Last nigga try to jump, left him deceased
Then we dumped him in the river, body still won't be seen

[Verse 3: Offset]
I’m a cool individual, selling dope, that's my principle
Young like the siminals, baking soda a chemical
I done made it out vakent, had to lie on David
Keep the pistol like Peet, and keep the knife like I'm Jason
I ain't Gigga for nothing, tell m fishing for money
Gotta bumblebee building, me and my crew, that's some hundreds
Took the truck to Bahamas, pick the plug up from London
I be sellin so many fishes, call me Offset Benny Hanna
And the 9 is my ratchet, trappin and stampin on matress
Singing Tony Braxtin, and they all wet like napkins
Biggest bitches, I'm cravin, got that dope, so come taste it
No, my swag is not basic, pull up with a strap, no laces[Chorus: Quavo]

Impress her, I introduced her to my life

Nigga, tryna rob me, for my Narcotics
If you ain't work, shame on you
She hit the trap twice, you a fuckin fool
Breakin rules, nigga, skippin school
Young nigga jumped in the money pool
That bitch fucked me, when you let her meet your mama
Bitch is suckin like a fuckin Piranha

Diamonds pissy, shit on you like Suel
Rich niggas, smell the devoore
Must be kidding me, coppy me, bitch, you a idiot
Between the lines, you eliterit
Workin, I had to deliver it

Bitches whippin' in the kitchen, bra and panties off
Never think 'bout juugin' cause they know I cut they fingers off
Catch me in Bahamas in Versace sandals
Takeoff got that A-1 dope whip game, Mrs. Campbells

Run wit' the pack then I'm cuttin' yo' throat, before I buy coke, I gotta get quote

Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist gameOn the last track of The Green Album, the whole Migo Gang going over a beat produced by “Versace” producer Zaytoven and calling the final product “Wrist Game”.Mention, that this is the only song, the third member of Migos, Offset having a verse on. Him being incarcerated from January to October 2013, might be the reason for this.Him being able to have a verse is because this song is taken from their collab album with Rich The Kid, called “Streets On Lock”, which has already been released in 2013 and was probably recorded before Offset went to jail.[Chorus: Quavo]
Million dollar make a nigga move

In the streets, I'm a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Sellin rolls, no cornrolls, nigga, I set it off
Gotta have a gass mask cookin in the kitchen, cause I cough
Send that work out to Memfis, so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know you is false
Rick Ross, and the only nigga in the world boss
4 Gs on the Cheavy, ridin old school T talk
When a nigga run up on me, freez him like a free froth
Feelin like a DJ, hit m with the Re Rock
Feelin like a lost nigga, Re Rock on the D Block
Fuckin with the Chi town niggas, out on the old block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on yo block

Codeine sippin, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm living
I'm draped up in gold but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I'm think I'm the don, but no Rocko
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store can't go back no more

Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec

Placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put 'em in a car then a young nigga skurrt
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walking round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, balling like a Net
And I got a Asian plug, no Jeremy Lin
Let the top back, let your hair blow in the wind
Finesse the plug, I don’t need a Benjamin
Judge out of trial so you know I'm innocent
Smoking on gas blunts longer than incense

My lil' nigga Shad got smoked
Hungry for the money, trying to get the dough

All this bullshit for a dollar bill
Hoes set you up, they don’t give a fuck

Got beans, got lean, got gas
Niggas better come with that cash
Gucci bag came with the flag

We ain't never got to worry about the popo
We eating on shrimp and gumbo
We smoking on blunts, they jumbo

Niggas out here in these streets, they Hungry Howie
Your BBS's ain't official they look cloudy
Hard top coup, but the inside Bounty
My lil Migo pull up on you, serve a couple brownies
Gotta strip the scene cause the block hot like a cauldron
Khaki foreign bad bitch, please excuse her manners
Straight drop dope, make the fiends go bananas
I get the zip, ship, then cost me 180
On the block for a minute flip one for 380

[Hook]
I got different kinda packs
All colored packs
Stupid flavored pack
Stanky Kush pack
Sour Diesel pack
Mango Kush pack
That gas, That gas
I got different kinda packs
All colored packs
Stupid flavored pack
Stanky Kush pack
Sour Diesel pack
Mango Kush pack
That gas, That gas

[Hook: Quavo]
I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I been had cash nigga, I don't need no label
Ever since a young nigga, I been chasing paper
Fuck with my block gang niggas in Decatur
Golf ball shots in your body like a crater
She fuck the whole team man, you don't need to save her
John Madden super bowl ring from the Raiders
You steppin' on my lawn, house with 44 acres
Go to the jeweler, walk out colder than a glacier
Wrist looking like a pack of fucking Life-Savers
Watch out for them goons cause I will put 'em on your table
Money stretching 'round the world like an equator
I don't need no label
BMG the label
Gone

[Hook]
I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label

[Verse 2: Offset]
I don't need no label
Money stack like Lego's
I been getting money VVS's on my navel
Pull up in a drop top coupe, look like the Mayor
Two cup, Styrofoam, filled up with maple
Pull up to the front of the club like I'm disabled
Two bitches in the kitchen cooking Vanilla Wafers
The Lamb outside, young nigga, yeah I own it
Don't like the mid around me, I don't condone it
Gucci aviators on my face to catch the focus
My bitch is not local, two bands around her shoulder
I don't need a deal little nigga I thought I told you
Pull up in a Lotus, to catch the haters focus

[Hook]
I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I don't need no label, I don't need no label
No Cash Money, No Limit
My money no limit
Riding in the Bentley, with the windows tinted
Foreign bitch is sucking, got to know they fucking
Rolling of a molly, rolling off a Xan
Calling up the plug for them stupid drugs
In the kitchen with them stainless steel like a chef
I don't need no label nigga I sign my damn self
I got loud, Xan, molly, and I got that meth
Pull up in Rari, Audi
The VVS's on my neck and rockin'
Been plugged in with the Haitian's
Stacking all my cash, Grants, Jacksons, and the Franklins

[Hook]
I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
